# Problem Statement

Given a chessboard of size N x N, place N queens on the board such that no two queens threaten each other. That is, no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

## Approach

We can solve this problem using the **A Star Search** algorithm. A Star Search is an uninformed search algorithm that finds the shortest path from a given initial state to a goal state.

### 1. State Representation

We represent each state as a placement of queens on the chessboard. Each state will be represented by the positions of the queens on the board.

### 2. Initial State

The initial state will be an empty chessboard.

### 3. Actions

The actions will involve placing a queen in an empty square on the board.

### 4. Transition Model

Given a current state, we can apply an action (place a queen) to generate a new state.

### 5. Goal Test

Check if all queens are placed on the board without threatening each other.

### 6. Heuristic Function

A heuristic function is required for A* Search. In the N-Queens problem, a common heuristic is to count the number of pairs of queens that are attacking each other. This heuristic should return 0 if the current state is a goal state.

### 7. Cost Function

In A* Search, the cost function is the sum of the path cost from the initial state to the current state and the heuristic value of the current state.

### 8. Search Algorithm

The A* Search algorithm explores nodes in the search tree based on the sum of the path cost and the heuristic value. It uses a priority queue to select the next node to expand.

## Pseudocode

```python
    function AStarSearch(initialState):
        frontier = Priority Queue(initialState)
        explored = Set()
        
        while frontier is not empty:
            currentState = frontier.pop()
            explored.add(currentState)
            
            if currentState is goal state:
                return currentState
            
            for action in possibleActions(currentState):
                nextState = applyAction(currentState, action)
                
                if nextState not in explored and nextState not in frontier:
                    frontier.push(nextState)
                    
        return failure
```

## Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the A* Search algorithm is O(b^d), where b is the branching factor (number of possible actions per state) and d is the depth of the solution. In the worst case, the algorithm explores all possible states.

The space complexity of the A* Search algorithm is O(b^d), as it needs to store all possible states in the frontier.

## Conclusion

The N-Queens problem can be efficiently solved using the A* Search algorithm by appropriately defining state representation, actions, transition model, goal test, heuristic function, and cost function. Implementing the pseudocode with these considerations will yield a solution that efficiently finds a placement of queens on the chessboard without threatening each other.
