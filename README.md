# AI Projects
This repository contains code for a few assignments for a unit called Artificial Intelligence.

Here are the questions themselves:
1. Write a program that solves the problem of measuring 2 liters using only a pair of uncallibrated 
    (i.e do not have measurement markings) 3 and 4 litre jugs using:
   i. breadth-first search (BFS)
   ii. depth-first search (DFS)
2. Write a Sudoku solver.
3. Write a single-player Tic-Tac-Toe game where the computer uses the min-max algorithm to determine its next move.
4. Solve the N-Queens problem by:
   i. using basic backtracking
   ii. approaching it as a CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem)
